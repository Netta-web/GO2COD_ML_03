House Price Prediction Model
This project aims to predict house prices based on a variety of features, leveraging machine learning algorithms to generate accurate price estimates. The model uses a dataset of historical house prices, including attributes such as location, size, number of rooms, year built, and other relevant features. By analyzing these factors, the model can provide price predictions for houses in similar market conditions.


Project Overview
Predicting house prices is crucial for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate investors to make informed decisions. This project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various machine learning techniques to optimize model performance. 

Key steps in the workflow include:

Data Collection: The dataset includes historical house price data and related features.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Creating additional features or selecting the most impactful features.
Modeling: Training multiple models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to compare performance.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
